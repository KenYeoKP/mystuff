### Apriori analysis using SPSS

Mock data comprising of 504 records of hotel reviews by travellers was fed into SPSS. After determining the appropriate antecedent support and confidence, the program generated an output showing that travellers who were travelling as couples were more likely to seek spa facilities than other amenities or services.

Using Apriori can help uncover relationships between attributes by establishing the link between antecedent and consequent. One well-known example is the beer-diaper relationship uncovered by a consultant for a large supermarket. When dads were asked to grab diapers, they often picked up a six-pack of beer too! So, if you were in charge of store layout, would you place these items close to each other or far apart? Weâ€™ll leave this puzzle for another day.
