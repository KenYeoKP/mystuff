## IBM K-Means

### K-Means analysis using SPSS

Mock data comprising of 504 records of hotel reviews by travellers was fed into SPSS. The data included information of travellers, their traveling periods, hotel reviews and facilities.

Clustering was carried out using the K-Means module in SPSS to identify clusters or combinations of hotel facilities that were preferred by travellers. For instance, were all six facilities, namely Casino, Spa, Free internet, Gym, Pool, and Tennis court, important to travellers? If not, what combinations of facilities were important to them or was there any facility that a hotel could forego without affecting customer satisfaction?

Using Apriori can help uncover relationships between attributes by establishing the link between antecedent and consequent. One well-known example is the beer-diaper relationship uncovered by a consultant for a large supermarket. When dads were asked to grab diapers, they often picked up a six-pack of beer too! So, if you were in charge of store layout, would you place these items close to each other or far apart? Weâ€™ll leave this puzzle for another day.
